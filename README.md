# Spell-Check
Spell checks text files and outputs all misspelled words. The program uses linked-lists to store and retrieve dictionary words.

### Improvements/Lessons to take for the next project.
The program would likely run faster and with less memory usage if a hash table were incorporated for the storage and search of dictionary words.
